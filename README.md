An Online Appointment Booking System from AlphaDevX

Problem definintion 

Covid-19 Pandemic and the new norm
The population in Malaysia is growing rapidly, which is estimated to be 32.7 million in 2021. However, since the Covid-19 pandemic, the Malaysian government has enforced social distancing measures to its citizens and eventually became a new norm. However, from our observation, there are still a lot of people who face the difficulty to avoid crowded places since they were not aware of the peak hours and the number of people in a particular location at that time. Hence, in order to minimize the risk of getting infected of Covid-19 virus, people tend to go to places which are not crowded instead. This precaution is pivotal in preventing potential clusters. Additionally, people could also skip the hassle of queuing for a long period of time because it is unnecessary, inefficient and a waste of time.

**Product Scope** 

In order to prevent this issue, AlphaDevX will develop an appointment web application that will allow users to reserve a desired time slot. Registration form will provide various time slots for the users to book an appointment for the particular service i.e to access a gym, to access a grocery store. The requested time slot will be checked with our database to ensure that the number of people during that time is within a certain limit. The user will be allocated an appointment slot in the case that the number of people is within the threshold set. If it crosses a certain limit on the number of people, then the booking of the appointment will be cancelled. After that, the user will be recommended several slots that they can choose to go on the same day.
